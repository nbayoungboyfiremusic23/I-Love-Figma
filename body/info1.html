<h1>Shiva. A band forged from the gritty suburbs of Sydney.</h1>
<h style="font-size:30px">They weren't born to conform to regular metal.</h>
<p style="font-size:20px">They came into the scene with one goal in mind, to try to fuse the likes of Nu-metal and deathcore into one, earpierceing genre which would leave everyone's ears craving for more.</p>

<h1>Vocals: Taylor Humphries
  Drums: Dylan Doyle
  Bass: Brent Crowe
  Guitar: Tano D'urso
  Guitar: Dylan Tadros</h1>
<p>Their unique, fast, aggresive style of music will for sure cement them into Austrlian metal history as time progresses.<p>
<h1 style="font-size: 40px">Now, who are they influenced by?</h1>
<p style="font-size:30px">Now, you don't even need the band to be there to answer to tell who they influenced by. Notes of Slaughter to Prevail's ruthless breakdowns, the ungodly highs emobodying the spirit of the late Mitch Lucker from Suicide Silence and fresh nu-metal riffs similar to those of Linkin Park sprinkled in their songs</p>
<p style="font-size:30px">Their music is available on Spotify, Youtube, Amazon, Bandcamp, Apple Music, and potentially live concerts and physical forms of listening as they continue to expand as a band.</p>
