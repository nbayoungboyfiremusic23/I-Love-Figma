  <h1>So... Why should I care about local bands? Why shouldn't I just listen to Chappell Roan and whatever’s on the radio?</h1>

  <p style="font-size:30px">
    Local bands are a pivotal aspect to the music scene in Australia, as they enrich the culture of Australia
    and provide major economic benefits to the country, as they fill up pubs and bars with live performances,
    and with your help, you can keep these talented bands afloat, as they suffer economically big time despite
    their contribution to the economy.

  <p style="font-size:30px">
    Though small artists/bands contributed around <span class="highlight">$15.7 billion</span> and produced
    <span class="highlight">80,000 jobs</span> in 2022 through a variety of bar/pub performances and smaller venues,
    around <span class="highlight">50%</span> of Australian artists didn't even make
    <span class="highlight">$6,000</span> from a year of musical work — roughly
    <span class="highlight">15%</span> of what a minimum-wage worker makes in Australia.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:30px">
    Another study by <em>The Bassline</em> shows that the median musician income is
    <span class="highlight">$14,700</span> a year — about a quarter of the national median.

<h1>Now you may be wondering, how can I support my local bands/get involved in the scene?</h1>
<p>You could help your local band by buying their merch, buying PHYSICAL AUDIO FORMATS, using more ethical streaming services like Tide which pay the most at around 0.013 cents per stream, which is significantly greater than other platforms. Also, don't underestimate the word of mouth. The good old way many bands have become popular, it can still be effective in this day and age. And it doesn't even have to be literal word in person, leaving a song on your Instagram note or putting the song on TikTok could help the band gain traction.</p>
