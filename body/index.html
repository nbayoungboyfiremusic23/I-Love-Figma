        SHIVA delivers absolute carnage and brutality with their debut album "Planet Eater"- it's everything great about deathcore. As soon as the first song "Hand of Death" hits, I'm already bobbing my head along and I was thrilled to be hearing music that reminded me of deathcore big players SLAUGHTER TO PREVAIL. The title track "Planet Eaters" has some vocals that will destroy your ear holes in the best way. The vocals are very reminiscent of early CHELSEA GRIN. Other bands I heard hints of throughout include some metalcore giants AFTER THE BURIAL, FEED HER TO THE SHARKS, and BORN OF OSIRIS.

      At 19 tracks Epilogue is a test of endurance. Though often jaw dropping, its runtime means only the most obsequious of extreme metal fans will make it through in one sitting. Regardless, it’s a record that will almost certainly be a game changer for TO THE GRAVE. If you thought BRAND OF SACRIFICE‘s Lifeblood was nailed on to be the best album deathcore had to offer this year: wait till you hear this one.
